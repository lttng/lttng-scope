= LTTng Scope
3 October 2018

**LTTng Scope** is a trace viewer and analyzer for
https://lttng.org/[LTTng] kernel and user space traces.

LTTng Scope supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. The source code is
available under the
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html[Eclipse Public License].

NOTE: LTTng Scope is not actively developed or maintained. Please
consider using https://eclipse.dev/tracecompass/[Trace Compass]
instead.

== Installation

=== Binary installer

See the https://lttng.org/beta/#lttng-scope[Beta section] of the LTTng
website for the latest downloadable installers for Windows, macOS, and
Linux.

The installers ship with the required Java virtual machine.


=== Build from source

You need:

* Java 8
* JavaFX
* http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] 3.3 or later

If you use Oracle's JVM, which is typical on Windows and macOS, then
JavaFX is already included.

If you use OpenJDK, you might need to install OpenJFX separately. On
Debian and Ubuntu, you can run the following command to install the
requirements:

----
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk openjfx
----

To build and install LTTng{nbsp}Scope from source:

. Clone this repository.
. Run:
+
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

When the `mvn` command finishes, you can start LTTng{nbsp}Scope:

----
java -jar lttng-scope-ui/target/lttng-scope-ui-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
----


== Relation to Trace Compass

LTTng{nbsp}Scope is based on some parts of the
http://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/[Trace Compass] source code. However,
it is meant to be a separate project with different design goals. While
Trace Compass aims to support any analysis for any trace type, LTTng
Scope aims to:

* Focus on LTTng use cases.
* Streamline the user experience.

Running analyses on the command line (in a CI server, for example) with
text-based output is also within the realm of possibilities.
